**Specify what you want it to build, the AI asks for clarification, and then builds it.**

GPT Engineer is made to be easy to adapt, extend, and make your agent learn how you want your code to look. It generates an entire codebase based on a prompt.

[Demo](https://twitter.com/antonosika/status/1667641038104674306) ðŸ‘¶ðŸ¤–

## Project philosophy

- Simple to get value
- Flexible and easy to add new own "AI steps". See `steps.py`.
- Incrementally build towards a user experience of:
  1. high level prompting
  2. giving feedback to the AI that it will remember over time
- Fast handovers back and forth between AI and human
- Simplicity, all computation is "resumable" and persisted to the filesystem

## Usage

Choose either **stable** or **development**.

For **stable** release:

- `pip install gpt-engineer`

For **development**:
- `git clone git@github.com:AntonOsika/gpt-engineer.git`
- `cd gpt-engineer`
- `pip install -e .`
  - (or: `make install && source venv/bin/activate` for a venv)

**Setup**

With an api key that has GPT4 access run:

- `export OPENAI_API_KEY=[your api key]`


**Run**:

- Create an empty folder. If inside the repo, you can run:
  - `cp -r projects/example/ projects/my-new-project`
- Fill in the `prompt` file in your new folder
- `gpt-engineer projects/my-new-project`
  - (Note, `gpt-engineer --help` lets you see all available options. For example `--steps use_feedback` lets you improve/fix code in a project)

By running gpt-engineer you agree to our [ToS](https://github.com/AntonOsika/gpt-engineer/TERMS_OF_USE.md).

**Results**
- Check the generated files in `projects/my-new-project/workspace`


## Features

You can specify the "identity" of the AI agent by editing the files in the `preprompts` folder.

Editing the `preprompts`, and evolving how you write the project prompt, is currently how you make the agent remember things between projects.

Each step in `steps.py` will have its communication history with GPT4 stored in the logs folder, and can be rerun with `scripts/rerun_edited_message_logs.py`.

## Contributing
The gpt-engineer community is building the **open platform for devs to tinker with and build their personal code-generation toolbox**.
