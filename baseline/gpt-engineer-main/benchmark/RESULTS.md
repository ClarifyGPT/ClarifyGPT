## Notes on the errors

Most errors come from that the "generate entrypoint" are incorrect. Ignoring
those, we get 8/11 fully correct.

All errors are very easy to fix.

One error was trying to modify a constant.
One error was that the html template was not fully filled in.
One error is that a dependency was used incorrectly and easy to fix
